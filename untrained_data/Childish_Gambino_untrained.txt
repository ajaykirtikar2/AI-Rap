Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood
When we walk up in the club
Then we can look up to the sky
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
The children are our reminder
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Ever, forever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now
All praise to

Get along

I used to walk on the beach at night.
I remember.
The best time was when, well, me and you,
We got all our friends and we got a tent.
We slept in it. Not the whole night, but just enough time.
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily.
Just not to me, but then we left.
The times have changed.
The pleasures that I feel.
They say you never say never, it's real.
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep.
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep.
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room.
Under the moon, romance.

Oh my, please don't take him away, no, no, no
Don't take him away
Oh, cause I had my doubts, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one and they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You said you're wrong but you knew
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall little one, walk tall
Let me hold you, let me hold youMiiri man ɲi!
Let me hold you, let me hold youWhen the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92, I listen
To what my father said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can
When you can
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall (oh I, nah, nah, nah)
If you are strong you cannot fall (if you are strong)
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side
Woo, oh!
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall
Give me morning, oh-oh-oh
When you're gone to yourself
Oh, oh!

Tie me down, try to hold me up
But the wall ain't high enough
And they play so hard
In a game so rough
But I still can't
Give it up
I'm out there on my own
Work but I got to get some
Run it right into the sun
Oh (jump so high)
(So high)
I jump so high (so high)
I got it right (so high, high, high)
I got it right
Find your life
In the darkest sky
And the stars burn
Inside our eyes
Cutting through the days
To our glory days
We won't give up
Never too late
Yeah, we finally made it
You know they hate it
I swear to God
Knowing just what you are
Made you into a star
Made you into the man
No one else like this
Before the house was a house
It was on my wrist
It's the island life, yeah mahalo bitch
Went from ashy to classy
I'm aloe rich, I stay Aloe Blacc
Man, Bino back
Man he never left
I smoke loud I'm deaf
Your smoke plead the fifth
I know the glory
They hate on your shine
'Cause they know the story
Thrown to the wolves but your drive so Mowgli
I could drive through the hood
And them, boys, they know me
Is he one of the greatest
Time will tell
But time is relative
They assume the melanin
And they kill the culture
This might insult ya
White man can't jump, and I
(Jump so high)
I got it rightMiiri man ɲi!
I got it rightI'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
(Let me into) Girl, you really got a hold, woahYou drink more than you used to
Fell in love how could you
Trust your heart like only fools do
Go on let it bleed
You smoked ten now it's twenty
Bet you wish you never met me
To stick around you must be crazy
I told you never to get used to me
I still awake when you fall asleep
I'm a whole lot of trouble
We're in a whole lot of trouble
I, I told you, you should never follow me
But here we are, and you're into deep
You shout louder than you used to
And you hold on tighter in the bedroom
Stick around like I'm a change soon
As you stand there trying to save me
Use your head and babe believe me
Gonna take much more than a heart to save me
I, I told you you should never follow me
But is it lyin' if you know that they don't want the truth
Is it cheating if you jerk it while she in the room? Realer than RedTube
Now you mad at the screen
We were something together
I wouldn't call it a team, just big trouble and little kindness
When I know the best parts are so behind us
Keep the pride tough, more than bad luck
I ain't messed up, I'm just wishing what we needed was a less us
I fell in love with the wrong dream
Crying in my arms what's it all mean?
I used to know those things and flow both wings
Thoughts where never ending and no Nuvaring's
And we fought for a patent pending on my new jack swing
Cool, calm and collected keep the Kool Moe Dee
Here is hoping you satisfy that like an addict
I had thought we'd never had to do those things
I told you you should never follow me
We're in a whole lot of troubleMiiri man ɲi!

Falling stars through the night sky 
I know we're broken parts, 
But ain't that just who we are?
We should be together-gether, yeah 
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy 
Everything's just better, better, yeah 
When I'm locked inside, 
You're the ties that free me 
Yes, we should be together-gether, yeah 
Together we hurt, together we take it 
(together-gether yeah) 
Together we fall, we'll never be breaking 
If we were apart, I know that we'd fade away 
Together we are, together we make it 
Everything that we both know, 
Summer nights left me so cold 
Let me dream of this fair love, 
All the things that I'm scared of 
I know we're far apart, 
I don't know where to start 
And I know what the people say, 
But I choose your love anyway 
Yeah, love so good ye coulda signed 
Got the one thing I couldn't buy 
Niggas so mad when I walk through 
With you on my arm, what they gon' do? 
Woman in my life, you're the top two 
Hi Mom! Lights on, lights off 
Dylon, rap like this, you're an icon 
Blue dream sounding like a pipe bomb 
You and me together, maybe we could do it 
Worst summer ever but we got through it 
Talk about the money, I was getting to it 
Where you wanna go, where you wanna go? 
Yeah! Let a nigga know, let a nigga know 
They ain't gotta know, they ain't gotta know, uh! 
When I'm locked inside, you're the ties that free me 
We should be together!Miiri man ɲi!
We should be together!Wake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love then and then we f*ck
And then you'd give me my space
Hey
What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it
Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
'Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
Right
The love is ours to make, so we should make it
It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say "guess what?" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be a round a baby so dumb high
I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that your smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days
We should stay right here
We should lay right here
'Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
'Cause everything is okay right hereMiiri man ɲi!
'Cause everything is okay right hereI was lost on the dark side, 
We should be together!I was lost on the dark side, 
We should be together!And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
Now I'm so highNo matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
F*ck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogain
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
We did it! Yay!
Nigga you so thirstyMiiri man ɲi!
Nigga you so thirstySomewhere this shit done got crazy
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy
With my hands on the steering wheel and my eyes on the pavement
I give a f*ck 'bout where they went
I owe my lawyer a payment
They talkin' 'bout no arraignment
Now I wonder where the rain went
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressin'
I been countin' what's on my bucket list and not on my blessin's
I think it's time for a lesson
Hold up, you better pay attention
I can't end up like my momma poppin' anti-depressants
My therapist think I'm crazy, or shit, she probably does
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs
Shit I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy bobbin' with this
I've just been driving (uh uh, nah, nah)
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy (uh uh, nah, nah)
That Bino the realest, this beat made me kill it
Her feet to the ceilin'
She said that she love me, she never said that in college
3005 Is our mileage
I'm in my lane like a Prius 'cause I'm movin' in silence
Still ain't broke down yet?
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left
Relationships look closer in that rear-view
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral
Yea, you really love her, but is she worth your future?
Your Ciara, your Beyonce they'll be saying he got money
Think that Kim be with Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?
Yea I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is
We were drivin' together, when we met we were kids
You ain't know 'bout the biz, I ain't know 'bout it either
I see you in that new ride, I flash my lights when I see you
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha (turn left on West Deer Park)
Doin' 90 on the highway, we gon' do it my way
90 On the high, 90 on the high
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy (been driving Ms. Daisy)
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy (been driving Ms. Daisy)Miiri man ɲi!
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy (been driving Ms. Daisy)And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
Now I'm so highNow that we have found this love, baby
It's whenever you like, make it feel good
These haters can't say shit, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never be alone, oh oh

Uh uh
Oh no no no
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
Young Bino in the house like an B&E;
Why I'm looking so fly
I'm just being me
Moved up, weed
In my girl clutch
White girls so
The twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
She need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down
Then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's alot of us
They talk shit
But nobody else ontop of us
Got popular
This the real shit
Get in the face
With a full clip
Get in the aim
Niggas don't slip
Then get
With the case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas
I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains
When really they livin'
We got abroad
This is world war three
I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down
I'mma steal that crown
I'mma do that thing
Girl you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident
With hair like Django
How we walk in the room
And the girls they notice
'Cus they know you bogus
I'm the man you noticed
And
I'mma show you how to do this
It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
F*ck that, f*ck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the gold coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
One more timeMiiri man ɲi!
One more timeOh no no, yeah
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)
Love don't really happen
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
(I see you dancing)
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
( I don't want to)
(I don't f*ck with that)
Now why can't every day be like this
Smoke a J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this
Like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this
Like this, no
Always be like this
Like thisMiiri man ɲi!
Like thisI just wanna roll with a cutie one
I ain't tryna catch no feels
We can get along sometimes
We ain't gotta be sincere
You ain't gotta laugh so small
Breathing all down my back
They ain't never had what we had
They ain't never felt like that
Cause them summer days
Never fade away
They just stay the same
In my mind, my mind
And them summer days
In my mind, no no
It's those summer days
It just stays the same
Never fear the change
Ok, Royalty is red hot
Shots from a redbone
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong
But can you disagree with that , versace on me
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G check
Didn't f*ck her for a month and never had a regret
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex
But really is we fucking yo
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
See she just graduated got a new job
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab
Got that boyfriend that she living with and don't smoke no more
But yo it's cool I liked her when I knew her back before like
In my mind, no noMiiri man ɲi!
In my mind, no noOne time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on them 
so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was, yours
It was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold
I was smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal maniac, imma show you the illest get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, n***a we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a prius she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that s**t expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
n***a imma monster, f**k it I'm a monstar
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god
I guess this ending's the best for me
But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind
Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get f*****g cheesy on this s**t
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man, juxta f*****g position
My n***a Jaden Smith dropping jewels and n****s don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith but
It's all about packaging right?
Real s**t though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of n****s is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore we just know what the most hype is s**t
Do you really like that s**t you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying? Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man, we some weak n****s man all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that s**t up
Apology ain't no real word my n***a
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even f*****g exist man
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist, and I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a f**k until I'm gone
So does it even matter?
Yes it doesMiiri man ɲi!
Yes it doesNo matter what you say or what you do
F*ck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up
'Til 3005, hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (but you ain't)
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up (but you ain't)
Hol' up, hol' up (but you ain't)Miiri man ɲi!
Hol' up, hol' up (but you ain't)Jump so high
I got it rightI shoulda saw it comin'
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby you were so good, so good
You had me goin' blind
You said it was your best friend, I'm guessing
I wasn't your type, hey!
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
Now that it's over
I just wanna break your heart right back
Right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Hey, all this time, I was blind running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby
You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he's gone, you're alone
Don't want you back
You're tellin' me you're sorry
Well sorry, my friend
'Cause I've already been there done that
Ain't doin' this again
No
Listen, you got a man but your man ain't loyal
Don't understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes I'm G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry had to tell you, I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, you know it's true 'cause
G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate but I don't know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back
Ooh, yeah
Runnin' 'round town tellin' everybody
I'm comin' out
He's comin'
I'm comin' outMiiri man ɲi!
I'm comin' outI shoulda saw it comin'
I'm comin' outMy mind goes round like a roundabout
Whistles and sings
Darker than darkest night
Sweeter than spring
Yeah mysterious (Mysterious), my mermaids are bi-curious
She done got intoxicated, girlfriend is furious
Just in case, I pack the paper in the briefcase
Rain water, roof taste, Pistol Pete
White Louis suitcase, with the singin' hook like Frankie Lymon
Shout to the Baywatch, David Hasselhoff hair
Or the Allen Iverson braids, zig zags on designer
Softened beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup
Edge up, I done got fed up
Ate the pork chop sandwich with the tartar sauce
In the packet that I found in my purple Prada pocket protector
I could say anything about luck, you need to shut the, f*ck up
Like an addict threw up, I done poured a four in a codeine
Sonic the Hedgehog club versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup
I done, I done poured a four in a codeine
My mind goes round like a roundabout
Nigga hold up, what is this?
You ain't supposed to be here, yeah your name wasn't on that list
We even checked the email that was sent from up above, or rather all around us
Screams in my dreams like a One Direction concert, so
We're on our own, so alone in the universe
We sent people to the moon and now we know just the two of us
By heart, my art, I don't wanna explain it
I knew it, he bullshit, he up his own anus
Instagrams with his fans, man, he wish he was famous
Stop talking about your heart, we give a f*ck, entertain us
Why this nigga the lamest, why his clothes so the plainest?
And I know the ones who hate us, be the sames to say we made it
Man f*ck the vindicated, and the faded, at least they influence
How do we become the God? Language we learned in fluent
Understand who you are, they told us to be patient
But it's pointless like the use of emojis in conversation
Question mark face
What does it mean?
It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens
But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terio
Yeah, you getting your shine, but nigga, are you eating, though?
If you're welcome, are you fine?
You will
Want to love yourself, free your mind
We are
Turnin' into the God we know
I will
Never give up hope, we'll be fine
My mind expands to a great degree
A feeling that must be free
All that's left is you and me
And you're goneMiiri man ɲi!
And you're goneLet's have relations
Let's have relations
You and me, me and you
Me and you
Hook up?
We'd never know
How could we know?
How could we know the stars would align
We'd never find each other
Star crossed
Star crossed tonight
Me and you, you and me
I'm saying
You and me
I think it's crazy, we've never met before
I'm wondering if we were supposed to meet in another life
I'm wondering
If tomorrow never comes
I don't want the sun to rise
If I could find you
Find you in the dark
Then I'm alright
And just maybe we
Maybe we, maybe we will play tonight
All I really want is
You and me and me
I see the lights
Shining on you, tonight
And my friends say
That we should try, we should try
We should try it out, right
I think it's one thing
To promise yourself to me
But I'm wondering if you can give me
A chance to see
Tonight
Let's try it out now
Hook up? Hook up?
Well I don't think you understand me when I say to you
That I'm really trying to know you better
Yeah, really trying to be with you baby
I really want you to let me in
Let me in, let me in, oh babe

Tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'm a be Scorcese
(My nigga hold it horizontal man, Be professional)
(Worldstar!)
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a
Let me flash on 'em
We all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talkin', you know the sound
Brrrr, money counting
Brrrr, AK
Brrrr, cell phone
Brrrr, hello?
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man
He got like, he got like hit on the side of the head
Man, he's like freakin' out
Like, it's like
We don't wanna be a (worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a (worldstar!)Miiri man ɲi!
And all I wanna be is a (worldstar!)All she needed was some
At a Clippers' game on the court-side
Watch a nigga' shoot like a .4-5
They mad at me, too, I got more fire
Why these bitches see you "go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' and rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there, say som', girl say som'
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house
All she needed was some
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'mma ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a menage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as f*ck
Cause I'm nervous as f*ck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Our neighbors
All alone, no no no noMiiri man ɲi!
All alone, no no no noLove me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no no no
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Like, (I can't remember)
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z & Beyonce, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
We were trying to forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh
The attitude
And I hope you understand, I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
But I miss them
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understandMiiri man ɲi!
I just hope you understandPower 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd called "Oakland" on Power 106
I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
Everything, that I needed
Now I finally got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don't like that shit at all
So retreating
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
I'm just tryna pass
But I'm really not ready girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know that you choose to stay, no
All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And you're saying it's because of the Internet
Try once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move, and we'll both be thirty soon
The only one I know is you, so the f*ck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in OaklandMiiri man ɲi!
In Oakland, in OaklandPower 106!
In Oakland, in OaklandWatching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"
I'm chillin', real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese, yo' girl, she jocking me
No hands like soccer teams and y'all f*ck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' 
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you 
Better than you doing you, f*ck it, what you gon' do?
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drink my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker, "vroom, vroom," ho
Ain't nobody
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half of MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-err-err-err": onomatopoeia, oh, I got my cool on! (Tell 'em, mane)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a f*ck about my family name
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, f*ck it, what you gon' do?Miiri man ɲi!
Better than you doing you, f*ck it, what you gon' do?No matter what you say or what you do
'Til 3005, hold up
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Saturdays with young lavishes
Beans, they took from the cabinet (whoa)
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
Hol' up (hol' up)
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like Lebron's mom
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
Nigga you so thirstyNo matter what you say or what you do
Nigga you so thirstyWe gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute (Wait a minute) do you like to party?
Cause if you don't, don't come over here
We got smoking (Blue dream)
Drinking (Cocaine)
Fucking
I wanna show you what it is
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool, and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fuckin' with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I woo the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
Been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I invite all these people to my motherfuckin' house
Get the f*ck out of my house!Miiri man ɲi!
Get the f*ck out of my house!Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
What does that change?
Can't sleep
3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin'
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia
So be it, say I'm over it
Playin' Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars
Stare at my hands, look at the moon, I can't find it, it's gone
What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright? Yeah
Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie
When I'm laughin', I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood so good I'mma kill that spider
Them kinda things they told me I no longer do that, but now you finally get it admit it
Go home, lock the door, watch cartoons for an hour turn off the lights, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse
Look at the rec
(Don't go, don't go, don't go)
(Don't go) Don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't goMiiri man ɲi!
Don't go, don't go, don't goI had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people
So many pretty faces
I talked to some birds
I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same
Who would have thought this
We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition
Keep them off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all
Cold water
Why try at all?
Why bother?
Just hold me close my darling
Who would have dreamed this?
You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
Night's fallen
Dark callin'
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darlingMiiri man ɲi!
Just hold me close my darlingWhen we were coming down they said it was too soon
I never had to lie no no no no
We were coming down, they left us all alone
Way to nowhere, nowhere. I know you've been around
I feel you better now, how are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken
I'm a good son
You're a good son
Arlanda hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can buy it out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know about photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids
Can't hold his goose
I'ma walk out, wanna walk too?
What about dude?
F*ck 'em, I just wanna feel something
It took my like five minutes to figure out what voices those were on the phone
But it figured it out
Is it real, cause you're on live
I'm a freaky bitch
I'm 5 foot 8, 390
And I am a freaky bitch
Heathen
It's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Crafmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga's preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost god never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven
Why miss it by two inches?
Old money and new bitches (Old money and new bitches)Miiri man ɲi!
Old money and new bitches (Old money and new bitches)When we were coming down they said it was too soon
Crying cause I'm stressed, TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
Old money and new bitches (Old money and new bitches)I watch them all pass by
The moon & the stars
Let me hold you in my arms, forever more
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing, by the side
Let you go, oh to the sea, just for me
Don't let me lose my life
Keep holding on
Let the modest go
As my mic goes to and from
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of them
'Cause I won't knowMiiri man ɲi!
'Cause I won't knowRainbows, sunshine, everywhere I go
Rainbows, sunshine, go
Rainbows, sunshine
I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know)
You don't leave home without it
(Move that kilo)
She on my back about it
(C3PO)
And all the time, ohh
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this liquor
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night, go
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20 K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way I should stay with someone like you
But I tell them no
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you
Cause I know one day, you could take me away, far away
I know you could pay all the money you made
There'll be plenty of sunshine
I never worry 'bout it
I have my nigga count it
(Back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold
Dressed up in gold
I'm out of time
(Go)Miiri man ɲi!
(Go)[Hook: Childish Gambino]
[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
(Act like you know) [x3]
(Move that kilo) [x3]
(C3PO) [x3]
[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
You never catch your boy bo-bimbin'
[Hook: Childish Gambino]
[Interlude]
Jhene Aiko's angelic harmonizing
[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you could pay all the money you make
[Outro]
I never worry ???bout it
(Back up them O???s) [x3]
She???s dressed up in gold
(C3PO) [x2]
I???m out of time
(Act like you know) [x3]Miiri man ɲi!
(Act like you know) [x3]See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
When the world was with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a deathwish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we're destined
See now I don't wanna see an era (an era)
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a damn about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005. The year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
Send them pics to my phone, GPOYMiiri man ɲi!
Send them pics to my phone, GPOYSee now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
Send them pics to my phone, GPOYMan made the web, you don't need a name
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid, quick, tell him he can't sit with us"
F*ck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real-D, hope they dig a nigga before they bury me
Even though, we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said "you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone, now I'm back
Give a f*ck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying "go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out, "it's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we f*ck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me "how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, "you see what these labels do to me"
Texts said "I'm Wet", I said "hold up, wait up a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, f*ck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now. You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you. You have to help me
Please help me
Please help meMiiri man ɲi!
Please help meMan made the web, you don't need a name
I'm gone - now I'm back
I had to figure it out; "it's the best," no, that's a lie
Please help meWhere we were, kinda thing, betcha crawl, all alone
Better than you doing you, f*ck it, what you gon' do?We gon' have a party
(Go)See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
Please help meCooler than Coolio, stay in that studio
Flyer than Peter Pan when I'm pushin' that morphio
That stone out in CEO, wishin' that you was me
Girls on the tour bus, keep that ratio two or three
Fly as I want, A-Town put 'em up
East side till I die, Like we don't give a f*ck
Keep your mouth so shut, talk is cheap
'Bino been here, y'all been sleep
'Bino hot and we know this
F*ck the rest, we've been chosen
Keepin' up with these Joneses
Still stunt with these hoes-es
So street like Elmo, so street like Elmo
'Bino ain't the coldest Man, you funny like my elbow
Always on some other shit, stupid like my type of rich
Damn, what kind of life is this? I'm driven like some licenses
Let they head nod when the beat go in
I'mma wait till the beat go in
You so sophisticated
Shout out to those who hated
Kill a rapper, try to spit at me, that's suicide
Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die
Shotgun, blast that when I pass through
When I do things in that UK, and I fucks mane with that Flux mane
Bino flow so honest, your check ain't got no commas
But I ain't got no worries like Adele my baby mama
I'm blown off that indo, blown off that indo
Told y'all I would blow up that shit happened like I said so
You see it, I got it
I want it, I buy it
I do it, you tryin'
This yo girl? You lyin'
Let they head out when the beat go in
I'mma wait till the beat go inMiiri man ɲi!
I'mma wait till the beat go inWake up, wake up
'Cause everything is okay right hereWake up, wake up
'Cause everything is okay right hereCooler than Coolio, stay in that studio
I'mma wait till the beat go inYou drink more than you used to
We're in a whole lot of trouble[Chorus: x2]
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have, isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we f*ck, till we come, to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause
[Chorus: x2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You coulda' wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a f*ck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I'm the best when I'm a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the f*ck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, f*ck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that
But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesomeMiiri man ɲi!
But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesomeOrdinary days but these ain't ordinary times
I lost to making waves, I know there's something on our minds
We need something so beautiful when you feel your losing ground
Someone to keep you straight up tall, 'cuz no one wants to fall, Fall
We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you
Tryna make a change, going down a different avenue
If anytime I stop, at least I know where I am heading to
So won't ya, join the revolution cuz I been missing you
'Till we all know where this story goes, we're climbing up these walls, Walls
Money left to burn, we can do whatever
Ain't you know that I'm a boss? Check my Kelsey Grammer
Stank attitude but she smilin' when we kiss
But I love my baby mama, cuz she do not exist
Do not mess with Bino, Egon with ego
Haters missed the goal like Shaq did with free-throws
Yo time un poquito, no habla un gringo
Do not knock on the door unless necessito
I’m chilling at the Waldorf, eating on some grapefruit
When everybody likes you, everybody hates you
That’s just the territory
I got to be honest, it’s very boring without a hater there to make a story
They want to tell you what’s in your heart, don’t start
Getting Salieri on my Mozart
I'mma play some Go-Kart with my little brother
Cause life is only living when we livin' for each other
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with youMiiri man ɲi!
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you[Chorus]
It feel like the same old story, everywhere that I go
And I don't really wanna do it all again tomorrow
So I'm trying to find something brand new
I'm sorry if you see me and I'm acting brand new
It feel like the same old bitches, same old haters
See me in the club, wanna come sit at my table
I'm trying to find something brand new
Motherfucker
No handouts for no niggas
No handouts for no bitches
Killed the underground with my lifestyle
I'll let y'all fucks be the witness
But I'm losing my mind
On the block like 9 and a 9
Well until it got pined
You ain't know that it's something about time?
We didn't care about that
Remember the time I said I rapped?
Then the niggas came after
Even the hoes was full of laughter
Flew back to the booth, went harder
Now node your heads to the product
Suck a nigga dick like he hotter
Slinky on the booty like your father
Beard look like Osama
Don't talk to me less about commas
Real shit, Go time get a meal tip
Save your compliments for the comments
Getting money is my assignment
Will still be in the set
[Chorus]
Damn, these niggas hating, I can't understand
I'm your favourite's favourite, you the fan of a fan
I feel like if I fall off this boat I could walk
Y'all rap, Cory Gunz talk what he talk
Shorty said she coming, she bringing a friend
They ain't smoking with me, though, cause they didn't put in
Bitch, I be touring with Tunechi and Mack
Saluting Stunna on the way to the stage and way back
How many niggas you know chill on the block with they fam and
Tell you if you need something handled, go and holla at Nick Cannon
Still spitting like I'm trying to get the deal
Don't fly private all the time, but I fly private with Shaquille
Same old haters, niggas just don't give a f*ck
Tired of that old shit, swag is on some Bentley truck
Tired of these zeroes, ain't nobody near, though
Cause ain't nobody ready, throw the paper like confetti
Man, I get jobs, a hundred stack
Ya'll miss Jobs, like Wozniak
I make y'all insomniac?
No more sleeping, nigga
What you thinking, nigga?
I got your girl and need that E like we the Weeknd, nigga
People figure, cause I don't like it unless it's brand new
Everything is old news, even all your club clothes
Look like shit I wear when I need something from the Whole Foods
Royalty the newest niggas fucking old dudes
[Chorus]Miiri man ɲi!
[Chorus]Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, f*ck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like nigga with hard R
Fly like the logo on my cousin's four forty
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like toe jam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, f*ck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
They told me I was awful man, that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
"You're my favorite rapper, now" Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?"
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
F*ck that, got goons like an arch-villain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit "first of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me
I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "owww"
Sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipino, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the f*ck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
And shit I'm doin' this year, Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Loony Tune
I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitchMiiri man ɲi!
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitchI used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
'Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside, we can follow the road
Outside, outside, no one knows
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
"Donald watch the meter so they don't turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you're young and black, don't believe 'em
You're still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby baby babyMiiri man ɲi!
Oh, baby baby babyNow when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be, perfectly
Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Fire fly
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe a afford a falafel for dinner, ugh
I'm so broke man
Scholarship apology
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy
Let 'em know
Now when they see us on the streets
It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga you act too soft
F*ck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, 'cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?
You won't speak to the hood, man
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And yous'a fake f*ck like a flesh light
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully
Shawty, we got so highMiiri man ɲi!
Shawty, we got so highOkay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "ow"
'Cause all I did was act me like a Loony Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitchWhat the f*ck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that's not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion
I wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We got all the shine we need to find
I said, "Baby, I'm okay," she said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
"Baby, I'm okay," she said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R;'s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, "I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man"
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bon's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
We need to find
Need to findMiiri man ɲi!
Need to findYou're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is trying to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes
Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry
Take my hand
You're somewhere out there after all
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wantedMiiri man ɲi!
You're all I ever wantedI wanted you to know
But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesomeAlright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk About His Dick Again
Nerdy ass black kid, whatever man, I'm sick of him
That well spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'till it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-baby's-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as f*ck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
F*ck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin' on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin', rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man he think that we feel that?"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I f*ck it
You really hate my lyrics now, or Kid Cudi's? Nigga
Runnin' this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, f*ck a backpacker
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosine, trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, f*ck you nigga, f*ck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black, I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin' to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass, super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
F*ck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
"He don't give back," how the f*ck can niggas say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that paint back, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on some real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
F*ck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh
Man, f*ck these backpackers
F*ck these backpackers
F*ck these backpackersMiiri man ɲi!
F*ck these backpackersBaby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us
Anyway
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Time wise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West end
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuckin' hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
And cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?
F*ck you
Can I have this dance?
Baby, you're the baddest
We could pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started datin' at your art school
'Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stalone
Yellow 9/11 Persian girl in the back car
But me writin' a verse the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analin' anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is east side, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great
Hotel penthouse, go on let it roominate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept goin'
(I hope nobody catch us)
Ooh girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry, 'cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say
I'mma piece of shit
Believe in this
I'm tellin' you
'Cause we barely knew, what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Oh oh
AnywayMiiri man ɲi!
AnywayOh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my help
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the f*ck these niggas
Try and hold me down, oh
You such a fuckin' lame
That's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious? What is this?
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to "Sky is the Limit" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope boy swag
I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter
Who was a radio head and okay at them computers
At the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead
Ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops 'cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is blackened serious
'Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids, one size fits all
Oh, I want it, yeah
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga
Uh
We the baddest nigga
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'
Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism
It's hard to pin it 'cause you'd only understand
If you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods
Or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say, "James Franco is the white Donald Glover"
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', and I said I'm stealin' rock back
Nigga
Try and hold me down, ohMiiri man ɲi!
Try and hold me down, ohIf we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They gave you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
I guess I'm fucking now
I'm getting used to it
It's cause I shine, and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
F*ck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that
And "Why you bein' mean to me Donald?" I never texted back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months and heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids I'd have the black K-swiss and reebok
If we were kids I wouldn't act like this but we not
If we were kids
You made a mistake
These dudes man you bathing in apes
Finding you is like finding Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah I'm skipping all of it
Black or white girls come with a set of politics
That's all I was saying
I'm a proud man
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus
And she's doing coke in front of me, but act like I don't notice
"There any breakage in that Trojan?"
She see what she wanna see
So I make her take plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbing hoes like OJ
They too busy trapping pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is do re
If you had told me the truth we'd be OK
Keep up with me, keep upMiiri man ɲi!

Tight jeans penny loafers, but I still drink a Bodine
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides

Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage with my family in front of me
I am what I am
Everything I wanna be
This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you. Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you. And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something. The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, "Can I tell you something?" And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said "yes" or "no" yet. And regrettably I end up using the word "destiny." I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter. Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, "okay." I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am.
I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off. It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: "destiny." Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them.
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts. This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned. I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't.Miiri man ɲi!
