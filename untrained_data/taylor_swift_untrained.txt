I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what!?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure (sure)
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now" (Ooh, look what you made me do)
"Why?" (Look what you made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh!)
Look what you just made me doI don't like your little games
Look what you just made me doWe were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, "Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
'Cause we were both young when I first saw youI don't like your little games
'Cause we were both young when I first saw youOh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I remember that fight, two-thirty am
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
(I can see it now)I don't like your little games
(I can see it now)How many days did I spend
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwin'
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue tied
Free rent, livin' in my mind
But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
It isn't love, it isn't hate
It's just indifference
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down
Laughed on the schoolyard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are, then one magical night
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It's just indifference (so yeah)I don't like your little games
It's just indifference (so yeah)We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop, I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth 
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true , for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (save you a seat)
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
LoverI don't like your little games
LoverFever dream high
In the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boys
Shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new
The shape of your body, it's blue
The feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool
That's what I tell 'em, no rules
In breakable Heaven but
Ooh, whoa oh
With you
Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
So cut the headlights
Summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you
Just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed
You'll be the last to know
Oh, it's new
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said, "I'm fine", but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I, snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed, "For whatever it's worth"
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil
It's new
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"I don't like your little games
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"I would be complex
I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before
I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay
For me to do
Every conquest I had made
Would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?
I'm so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
They'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollas
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad
If I was a man (you know that)
Coming at me again (coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)
As fast as I can (as fast as I can)
If I was a man (hey)
I'd be the man (oh)
I'd be the man (yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
(If I was a man, I'd be the man)I don't like your little games
(If I was a man, I'd be the man)Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
I've been the archer,
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Who could stay?
You could stay
You
Combat, I'm ready for combatI don't like your little games
Combat, I'm ready for combatI think he knows his footprints
On the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows his hands around
A cold glass
Make me wanna know that body
Like it's mine
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm seventeen, nobody understands
No one understands
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh! I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude
Like, I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait
He's so obsessed with me, and boy I understand
Boy I understand
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
So where we gonna go?
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go?
I ain't gotta tell him
I think he knowsI don't like your little games
I think he knowsYou know I adore you
I'm crazier for you
Then I was at sixteen
Lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory
Faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
Ah, ah, ah
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there
It's been a long time coming but
It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl" (okay!)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay!)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away
My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high fives
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories
Burning before me
I'm feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys, then
Where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared
No cameras catch my muffled cries
And now the storm is coming, but
And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (go)
'Cause I know this is a (fight)
That someday we're gonna (win)
They whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know
You should know
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)
Just thought you should know
You and me
"She's a bad, bad girl"I don't like your little games
"She's a bad, bad girl"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
(Hey!) Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night
(Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life
(One, two, one two three four!)
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Paper rings and picture frames and dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so proud, so
(Hey!) Kiss me once 'cause I know you had a long night
(Oh!) Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh
You're the one I want
Darling, you're the one I want
Paper rings and picture frames and all my dreams
You're the one I want, and
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I wantI don't like your little games
You're the one I want, one I wantWe were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrowhead
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
Windows swung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (city screams your name)
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
Oh, never again
I don't wanna lose you, hope it never ends
I don't wanna lose you, yeah
I say casually in the carI don't like your little games
I say casually in the carMy, my, my, my
(My, my, my, my)
My, my, my, my
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours
Is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united, we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
'Cause you're not my baby
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (you didn't touch)
My body, my love
My trust (it's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
They say, "I don't know"I don't like your little games
They say, "I don't know"We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just riding in London
Alright
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet, darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
Boy, I fancy you (ooh)
And now I love high tea, stories from uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babe, don't threaten me with a good time
But God, I love the English
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
Boy, I fancy you
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (oh)
I enjoy walking SoHo, drinking in the afternoon (yeah)
Like a child when our eyes meet, darling, I fancy you (you)
So I guess all the rumors are true (yeah)
You know I love a London boy (oh)
Boy (oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)
I, I, I fancy you, oh
Just wanna be with you (ooh)
I fancy you (yeah), fancy you
Oh, ahI don't like your little games
Oh, ahThe buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's-office-lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you
Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better
Ooh-ah, you'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I'll say to you
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to
Ooh-ah, you'll get better
'Cause you have toI don't like your little games
'Cause you have toWe were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith
Blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
We'd still worship this love
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
We'd still worship this love, hmm
Still worship this love
Still worship this loveI don't like your little games
Still worship this loveYou are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark age
Just makin' that sign must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
Like can you just not step on his gown?
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (you need to calm down)
You're being too loud (you're being too loud)
You need to just stop (can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm downI don't like your little games
You need to calm downI blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
Hey
It's all me in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say, hey
It's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
I'm sorry that I hurt you
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
Meet me in the afterglowI don't like your little games
Meet me in the afterglowI promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Let me keep you company
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, one, two, three
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in "team"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
Me-e-e (yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (and I won't stop, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh)
You're the only one of you (oh)
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm the only one of me (oh-oh)
(Eeh-eeh-eeh)
Strike the band up, one, two, three (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you (yeah, yeah)
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-eI don't like your little games
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e(Ooh)
(Ooh)
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?"
Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
It's nice to have a friend
Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
Twenty questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately? Yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "babe"
Have my back, yeah, everyday
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend
(Ooh)I don't like your little games
(Ooh)(Ooh)
(Ooh)My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed, unforgiven
I'll tell you truth, but never, "Goodbye"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now
(I can never look away)
(Things will never be the same)
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
And I can still see it all (in my mind)
All of you, all of me (intertwined)
I once believed love would be (black and white)
But it's golden (golden)
And I can still see it all (in my head)
Back and forth from New York (sneakin' in your bed)
I once believed love would be (burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight
Daylight
And now I see daylight (I see daylight)
I only see daylight (oh)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (and I can still see it all)
(Back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (I once believed love would be burnin' red)
It's golden
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go
Let it go
"I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
The things that haunt me in the middle of the night, I
I just think that you are what you love"I don't like your little games
I just think that you are what you love"I promise that you'll never find another like me
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
Hey, kids!
Spelling is fun!
Girl, there ain't no I in "team" (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-eYou are somebody that I don't know
You need to calm downCombat, I'm ready for combat
Combat, I'm ready for combatYou are somebody that I don't know
You need to calm downWalkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said
Welcome to New York
It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Welcome to New York (New York!)
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
New soundtrack
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New YorkI don't like your little games
Welcome to New YorkWhat a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe
What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe?
This is the last time
Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe (how could you do this babe?)
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time (we're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball)
You said I'm no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babeI don't like your little games
I'll never call you babeYou, with your words like knives 
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again, 
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails 
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
You can take me down 
With just one single blow 
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday I'll be living in a big old city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides 
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again 
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, 
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 
'Cause you can't lead me down that road 
And you don't know what you don't know
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game 
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting 
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing 
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday I'll be living in a big old city 
Yeah someday I'll be big enough 
So you can't hit me 
Why you gotta be so (mean)
Someday I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
Why you gotta be so mean?I don't like your little games
Why you gotta be so mean?Strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said "yes"
You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no
Baby, and you might still have meI don't like your little games
Baby, and you might still have meThe way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile
My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
When sparks fly oh baby smile
When sparks flyI don't like your little games
When sparks flyI remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (what?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
We called it off again last night
But ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
You called me up again tonight
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh yeah
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh
I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
"Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know
Like we are never getting back together like, ever"
(No) We are never ever, ever getting back together
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
(We) ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh (getting back together)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherI don't like your little games
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherI used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the endI don't like your little games
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the endElevator buttons and morning air,
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now, 
My time is theirs.
Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,
You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,
So don't you worry your pretty little mind, 
The water's rough,
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate,
If it's wrong and,
Your hands are tough but they are where,
My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
'Cause my heart is yours.
And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
But they can't take what's ours,
They can't take what's ours,
But this love is ours.I don't like your little games
But this love is ours.You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight
You know that I've seen
Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights, fallin' off
The silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing keeps me together
At the seams
Just set me free
Yeah yeah
Home sweet homeI don't like your little games
Home sweet homeRat tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
He deals out in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy he's runnin' a gang
But I hear he's doin' okay
Got a cozy little job sells the Mexican mob
Packages of candy cane
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's getting paid
Jimmy's got it wired, law's for hire
Got it make in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he'll always be found
Selling sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy's town
He's gonna be your Frankenstein
I've got one thing you'll understand (Dr. Feelgood)
He's not what you'd call a glamorous man (Dr. Feelgood)
Got one thing that's easily understood (Dr. Feelgood)
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood oh yeah
He'll tell you he's the king of these Barrio streets
Moving up to Shangri La
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two time loser running out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumor going round
Jimmy's going down
This time it's gonna stick
Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand (Dr. Feelgood)
Some people call him an evil man (Dr. Feelgood)
Let him introduce himself real good (Dr. Feelgood)
He's the only one they call feelgood (Dr. Feelgood)
Dr. Feelgood (Dr. Feelgood)
Feelgood, Feelgood, Feelgood, FeelgoodI don't like your little games
Feelgood, Feelgood, Feelgood, FeelgoodUntouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
Untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
Oh
We could form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
Little taste of heavenI don't like your little games
Little taste of heavenWhat a shame
I'll never call you babeThis ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, your mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
DelicateI don't like your little games
DelicateI wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away, whenever you need me
I'm in a G5
Come to the A side
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
You love it
I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your A Team
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say
I know what they all say
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ahh
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
I wanna be your endgame, endgameI don't like your little games
I wanna be your endgame, endgameWhat a shame
I'll never call you babeOh, oh, oh
(I can see it now)Loving him is like 
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Oh, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Remembering him comes in flashbacks
And echoes
Tell myself it's time now
Gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
'Cause loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Yeah, yeah, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Oh, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Comes back to me, burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Yeah, yeah (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetI don't like your little games
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetI remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherOne look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words
'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You're in love
You're in loveI don't like your little games
You're in loveYour little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Could still be little
It could still be simple
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Just never grow upI don't like your little games
Just never grow upKnew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now
(No one has to know)
In the middle of the night in my dreams
Ooh, are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?I don't like your little games
Are you ready for it?This ain't for the best
DelicateKnew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Are you ready for it?I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your endgame, endgameI never trust a narcissist
But they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them
They tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
I never trust a playboy
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin'
What I do next
You gotta leave before you get left
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'
It just felt so good
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Oh, you say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, goodI don't like your little games
It just felt so good, goodDon't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and
Toyin' with them older guys
Just to play things for me to use
Something happened for the first time, in
The darkest little paradise
Shakin, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say she's gone too far this time
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes, love your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay
I get so high, oh
Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time, yeah every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
Usin' for the rest of my life, oh
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life, oh
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it)
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')
I'd be usin' for the rest of my lifeI don't like your little games
I'd be usin' for the rest of my lifeThis ain't for the best
Look what you just made me doSee you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone
'Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
And our pieces fall
Right into place
Get caught up in the moments
Lipstick on your face
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusion is
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
Who's counting?
1, 2, 3
And our pieces fall (pieces)
Get caught up in the moments (caught up, caught up)
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
So, so, so it goesI don't like your little games
So, so, so it goes(Gorgeous)
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But, what can I say?
You're gorgeous
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
But what can I say?
You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeousI don't like your little games
You're gorgeous(No, nothing good starts in a getaway car)
He was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match 
And blew your mind, but I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
And shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
X marks the spot
Where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
You were drivin' 
The getaway car
We were flyin'
But we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're ridin' 
In a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
In a getaway car, oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts 
It was the great escape
The prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us
I was screamin', "Go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a side show
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry
(We're both sorry)
He poisoned the well
Every man for himself
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
There were sirens 
In the beat of your heart
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (ohh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (ohh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (go!)
Drivin' 
There were sirens
(Should've known) should've known I'd be the first to leave
I was ridin' 
I was cryin' 
I was dyin' 
Said goodbye in 
A getaway car
Ridin' 
I was dyin'
A getaway carI don't like your little games
A getaway carI'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up on my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes
So prove to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
And all at onceI don't like your little games
And all at onceI, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know, and
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know that
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
And I had a bad feeling
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Hands tied, hands tiedI don't like your little games
Hands tied, hands tiedOur secret moments in your crowded room
They've got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub, you kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing about
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth of me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
My hands shake, I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it offI don't like your little games
Only bought this dress so you could take it offThere's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's going to be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or you're making mistakes
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There's glitter on the floor after the party
You and me forevermore
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhereI don't like your little games
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhereWhat a shame
I wanna be your endgame, endgameYou, with your words like knives 
Why you gotta be so mean?I remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherKnew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Are you ready for it?My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was, 'cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressin' up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
I want to wear his initial
On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holdin' my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (would you run away?)
(Call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want
ToI don't like your little games
ToBeen sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
I see you around in all these empty faces
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
Until you come back homeI don't like your little games
Until you come back homeShe was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she would be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted then, as she brought them to their feet
She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, "If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight"
She was a big star
She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawlin' all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers
She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertain is where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud, "Man that could be us"
She's a big star and she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says, "If you work hard to get where you are
She's a big star, she's a big starI don't like your little games
Look what you just made me doBeen sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
Until you come back homeBeen sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
Until you come back homeI walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah
Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too wellI don't like your little games
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too wellHe said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
But this is gettin' good now
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is
Starin' at the sunset babe
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ha, ha)
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Burnin' (burnin'), it (it), down (down)
Follow (follow), you (you), around
(Follow you around)
Standing in a nice dress
Even if it's just pretend
Even if it's just in your (just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, haI don't like your little games
In your wildest dreams, ah, haLoving him is like 
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetDrew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight
Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't seeI don't like your little games
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't seeI was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he said,
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our songI don't like your little games
And I wrote down our songIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers 
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time
Uh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright, if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I bet you want to
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two, twenty-two
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who ist Taylor Swift anyway? Ew")
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks
(Hey) I don't know about you
Everything will be alright if (uh-uh-uh)
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two 
(Uh, ah-ah-ah uh) twenty-two
twenty-two  
twenty-two 
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
You look like bad news 
I gotta have you
I gotta have you 
Uh-uh, uh-uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
Everything will be alright, if (uuh)
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
Uh-oh, oh, oh twenty-two 
(Dancing like) twenty-two
Yeah, yeah, twenty-two, yeah, yeah
It feels like one of those nights 
You look like bad news
I gotta have youI don't like your little games
I gotta have youOnce upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas
I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate
Just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me
Just met
But girl I got the remedy
Most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad
Too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
'Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile
Oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile
Oh dang
And I could care less that you famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
'Cause my first name Big
Last name Trouble
When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble!I don't like your little games
Trouble, trouble, trouble!You, with your words like knives 
Why you gotta be so mean?(Oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh)
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking come the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say, are you insane, -ane?
Say it's been a long six months (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
That's how you get the girl, girl
Remind her how it used to be, be
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say
I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever)
That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah
And you could know, oh
That I don't want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah
And then you say I want you for worse or for better (worse or for better)
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)
(That's how it works) and that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh (get the girl)
That's how you got the girlI don't like your little games
That's how you got the girlSee you in the dark
So, so, so it goesOh, oh, oh
(I can see it now)The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
When sparks flyI'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never 
(Never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know
Is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is great and wild
And I never (oh-oh, oh-oh, ouh-ooh)
(Never) 
Saw you coming (oh-oh, oh-oh, ouh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ouh-ooh)
And I'll never (oh-oh, oh-oh, ouh-ooh)
This is a state of grace
This is the worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
Yeah, oh-oh
(So you were never a saint)
(And I loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (we learn to live with the pain)
(Mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is great and wild)
Unless you play it good and rightI don't like your little games
Unless you play it good and rightYou and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and its all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake
Holding my breath, won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead
Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone
No
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started
Can't go back, I'm haunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see itI don't like your little games
Never thought I'd see itYour little hands wrapped around my finger
Just never grow upPut your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
And I, I, I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
I, I, I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive 
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
I, I, I 
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I, I, I like itI don't like your little games
I, I, I like itWhat a shame
I'll never call you babeWalkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Welcome to New YorkThere I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't have somebody waiting on youI don't like your little games
Please don't have somebody waiting on youElevator buttons and morning air,
But this love is ours.Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided) to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
Are we out of the woods?
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying baby, I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me
You were looking at me
Oh!
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Oh, I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, goodI don't like your little games
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, goodYou said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
(Aah) ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you and you are worlds away
New York, be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
(Aah) come back, be here
(Aah) come back, be hereI don't like your little games
(Aah) come back, be hereI don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
The way I do
I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's okay
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly
And that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girlI don't like your little games
Oh, I'm just a girlClear blue water
High tide, came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will, skies grow darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is a life back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me, oh
Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
This love, this love, this love, this love (Oh)
This love, this love, this love, this love
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, just to run
But you come back to what you need
And, this love came back to me, oh
(This love) This love that's a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free
(This love) And this love came back to me, oh
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)I don't like your little games
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)New to town with a made up name
In the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oooh
Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty
You just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh-ooh
It was a few years later
I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oooh
Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-uh, oh, ohI don't like your little games
Oh, oh-uh, oh, ohI see your face in my mind as I drive away,
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
But I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
And sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
It's two am
Feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy,
Easy for me
Hope you know this ain't easy,
I can't,
Sorry (oh) sorry
Sorry sorry
Sorry sorryI don't like your little games
Sorry sorryTook a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turned the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wait
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
But on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches
Every single Christmas and I won't
Talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Then on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin again
Then on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin againI don't like your little games
Then on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin againSeems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you
Hold on, baby; you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go, and no one knows
That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're givin' it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, babyI don't like your little games
With a smile, baby, babyI used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the endI am not the kind of girl,
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends,
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say
"Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,"
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?
Don't say yes, run away now,
You need to hear me out,
Your time is running out,
I hear the preacher say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace,"
There's a silence, there's my last chance,
I stand up with shaking hands,
All eyes on me,
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you
I am not the kind of girl,
And you say, "Let's run away now,
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door,
Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"I don't like your little games
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland, eh
In wonderland
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind
Oh darling, we found wonderland
(In won-) In wonderland
I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
Oh, we found wonderland
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (In wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderlandI don't like your little games
In wonderlandI said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were seventeen and crazy running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was tryna to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things"
Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
Ooh, ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh dancing with me
Ooh, ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
(Huh-huh-huh)
"Oh, my what a marvelous tune"
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible thingsI don't like your little games
Don't you dream impossible thingsI I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I
I I I I, I I I I, I I
You stand with your hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight (I I I I, I I I I)
I can hear them whisper as we pass by (I I I I, I I I I)
It's a bad sign, bad sign (I I)
Something happens when everybody finds out (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling dark clouds (I I I I, I I I I)
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out (I I I I, I I I I)
It could burn out (I I)
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I)
And we run
Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it (I I I I, I I I I)
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it (I I I I, I I I I)
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
(I) They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
(I) And you know for me it's always you
(I) In the dead of night, you're eyes so green
(I) And I know for you it's always me
(I I I I, I I I I)
(I I I I, I I I I)I don't like your little games
(I I I I, I I I I)Don't blame me, love made me crazy
I'd be usin' for the rest of my lifeIt was so nice throwing big parties
Jumping to the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head
I'm locking the gates
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed my back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately, hm hm
If only you weren't
So shady
This is why we can't have nice (nice things)
Things (baby) honey
This is why we can't have
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about that he said, she said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
I can't even say it with a straight face
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them, I want to take them 
Nice things, honey (they don't care about that he said, she said)
This is why we can't have nice thingsI don't like your little games
This is why we can't have nice thingsThere's glitter on the floor after the party
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhereKnew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Only bought this dress so you could take it offIt was so nice throwing big parties
This is why we can't have nice thingsMy castle crumbled overnight
ToThere's glitter on the floor after the party
It just felt so good, goodNice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
You can tell me when it's over (over), mm
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (yeah)
And I'll write your nameI don't like your little games
And I'll write your nameBeen sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
Until you come back homeI stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm hmm, that's what people say, mmm hmm
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm mmm, that's what people say mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind, sayin' it's gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see mmm mmm, that's what they don't see mmm mmm
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own), I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know mmm mmm, that's what they don't know mmm mmm
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats in the world 
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake, yeah oh
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate me)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (the fakers baby)
I, I shake it off, I shake it offI don't like your little games
I, I shake it off, I shake it off'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back, brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go)
If you love like that, blood runs cold
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!I don't like your little games
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!You, with your words like knives 
Why you gotta be so mean?We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
So get knocked off our feet
The best people in life are free
We're all here
the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But, honey most of them are true
To get knocked off our feet
So come on, come along with me
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (it's so romantic)
The best people in life are freeI don't like your little games
The best people in life are freeNice to meet you, where you been?
And I'll write your name'Cause baby now we got bad blood
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!Nice to meet you, where you been?
And I'll write your nameThere's somethin' bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.
[Chorus]I don't like your little games
[Chorus]This is wrong but
I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
Sweet, sweet superstar
SuperstarI don't like your little games
SuperstarYou should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing, missing)
What do you say, when tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you"
Ooh, I knew
Ooh
You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry too"
And that was the moment I knewI don't like your little games
And that was the moment I knewFlashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
In wonderlandOne look, dark room
You're in loveWalkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
Welcome to New YorkNice to meet you, where you been?
And I'll write your nameMidnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you" and I
I said "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
'Cause we never go (We never go) out of style, we never go out of style
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home, oh
(Out of style) You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of styleI don't like your little games
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of styleLooking at it now
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road
Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
All you had to do was stay (stay, stay, stay)
Let me remind you this was what you wanted (oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Well could've been easy (all you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay (oh)
All you had to do was stay (ooh)I don't like your little games
All you had to do was stay (ooh)I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
I, I shake it off, I shake it offIt's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start
You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I)
2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark
Guess you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish I, I wish I)
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)I don't like your little games
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)'Cause baby now we got bad blood
(Hey) now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
And baby now we got bad blood
(Hey) did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining, now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? baby I couldn't breathe
And rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
(Hey!) did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way, just don't
(Hey!) band-aids don't fix bullet holes
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)
You say sorry just for show (hey!)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs cold!
You know it used to be mad love! (mad love)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood! (bad blood)
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
('Cause now we got bad blood) 'cause baby now we got bad blood
So take a look at what you've done (look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (woah)
Now we got problems
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)I don't like your little games
And baby now we got bad blood (hey!)He said, "Let's get out of this town
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha(Oh oh oh)
That's how you got the girlClear blue water
This love, this love, this love, this love (This love came back to me, oh)I I I I, I I I I
(I I I I, I I I I)The drought was the very worst, ah ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do, ah ah
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst, ah ah
Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah
Think I'm finally cleanI don't like your little games
Think I'm finally cleanFlashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
You're in loveWe're all bored
In your wildest dreams, ah, haI I I I, I I I I
You stand with a hand on my waist line (I I I I, I I I I)
Good to see that we're out in blank side (I I I I, I I I I)
See the vulture circling in dark cloud (I I I I, I I I I)
Lights flash on the run for the fences (I I I I, I I I I)
Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time (I I I I, I I I I, I I)
(I) They take their shots, we're bulletproof
(I) In the dead of night, you act so great
Think I'm finally cleanTook a deep breath in the mirror
Then on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin againBet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're goin' way too fast
You're tryin' not to think about what went wrong
Tryin' not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're tryin' to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, hm baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bendin' God's ear talking 'bout me
You're tryin' not to let the first tear fall out
You're tryin' not to think about turnin' around
You're tryin' not to get lost in the sound
But that song is always on
So you sing along
I can't live without you, I can't live without you baby, oh baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby
The highway don't care
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby (the highway don't care)
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby (but I do, I do)
I can't live without you (the highway don't care)
The highway don't care, the highway don't care
(The highway don't care) I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
(The highway don't care) the highway don't care (the highway don't care) the highway don't care
I can't live without you, I can't live without you baby, oh baby (but I do, I do)
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, babyI don't like your little games
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, babyLoving him is like 
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherElevator buttons and morning air,
But this love is ours.I remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherLoving him is like 
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
I gotta have youYou good to go?
All I knew
This morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen
Since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel
In my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like
Everything has changed
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
Come back and tell me why
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
All I know is we said, "Hello"
Your eyes look like comin' home
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
Is everything has changedI don't like your little games
Is everything has changedI remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherOnce upon time
Trouble, trouble, trouble!It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
I gotta have youI remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherI remember when we broke up, the first time
But right now,
But this love is ours.You good to go?
Is everything has changedOnce upon a time
Without me
And I realize
The blame is on me
'Til you put me down, oh
So, shame on me now
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
He was long gone
When he met me
The joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in, oh-ooh
Till you put me down, oh
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Oh, oh (yeah)
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me 
Or her
Or anyone
Or anything
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there, knew it right there)
(Uuh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Trouble, trouble, trouble, oh
Trouble, trouble, troubleI don't like your little games
Trouble, trouble, troubleYou good to go?
Is everything has changedIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
I gotta have youIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back togetherOnce upon a time
Trouble, trouble, troubleIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
I gotta have youWe were both young when I first saw you
'Cause we were both young when I first saw youI'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Unless you play it good and rightLoving him is like 
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end streetPut your lips close to mine
I, I, I like itOnce upon time
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And now I see, now I see, now I see
And I realize the joke is on me
Trouble, trouble, troubleI walked through the door with you, the air was cold
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too wellIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
I gotta have youI bet
This time of night you're still up
I bet
You're tired from a long hard week
You're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
You think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet 
It never ever occurred to you
That I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do
It takes everything in me, not to call you
Uh-uh-uh
And I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout meI don't like your little games
Sometimes you wonder 'bout meI remember when we broke up, the first time
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
