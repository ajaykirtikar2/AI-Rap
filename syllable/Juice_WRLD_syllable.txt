Lome at home and I'm fallthin' like the show, it's over
We don't det no one tell you different
No lames allowed, you should really keep your distance
Red bottom kicks I feel like stomping in here
My heartrions, give a f*ck about my teachers
I can't tell what's real or where I belong
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
It's a thin line between all this love and hate (okay)
'll be high as hell before the night ends (yeah)
I turn up, and I'd never abuse you
Oh, my last time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainâ€™?
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
Nigga, you ain't do shot resper be highere
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
I don't know if it's because my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
Listening to my heart instead of my head
I'm a loner 'til the end, goddamn
(Instead of my head, you found another)
You don't want that shit like she get slied I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
Bickin' back, I'm boolin', these niggas flodgin'
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
I told you I was they say they wanna read my mind
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad ain't got no friends
Telling you rI don't even believe in karma
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that came when I'm wasted
She do cocaine in my face, I could pick one
Make her pop it Jountin (Oxycontin)
Look at my clique, to die, was never scared
Never ever am, what I never did
You was never there, no, you never was
Pay up that cash, you owe me, yeah, huh bitch, I need it
Matter fact, f*ck that shit, I'm rich, you can't feel, I feel
Back on my bullshit, devil emoji
Told the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
You left me falling and landing insside co, they workin'
I party never ever am, what I never did
And I feel you up the next day in the Monte Carlo
And they try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
But hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
Came up on a couple of million, uh
I invery day I be some blue face off the shrooms
The way that I hit her, I think she bring my brain, love
Bank afro, uh-huh, uhen tent to me
Ristening to my heart instead of my head
Tell me why you had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish
Check that bitch like she got Nike on her
Look at your bitch, shout your drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her of I'm screamin' in Flan my Hell
Yeah, I f*ck with him, I f*ck with him for real
It's to the point where I love, you a be the best
A loved me f*ck, huh, gun out or out my face
